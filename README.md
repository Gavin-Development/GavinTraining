# Gavin Training Repo
This Repo is for the Training of Gavin. A Transformer Based Chat Bot. 
At current time he uses the 
[Reddit Comment Data](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3bxlg7/i_have_every_publicly_available_reddit_comment/).
This Allows for some rather coherent responses. Under the correct Training conditions.
